 * For schema generation, it might be useful to specify that a column or columns
 * be indexed, and to provide the name of the index. For this purpose, an index
 * element can be contained within a field, element, key, value, or join
 * element, and this indicates that the column(s) associated with the referenced
 * element should be indexed. Indexes can also be specified at the class level,
 * by including index elements containing column elements. In this case, the
 * column elements are mapped elsewhere, and the column elements contain only
 * the column name.

     * <ul>
     * <li>
     * A column, or combination of columns, that is not the primary key.
     * Multiple UNIQUE constraints can be defined on a table, whereas only one
     * PRIMARY KEY constraint can be defined on a table.
     * </li>
     * <li>
     * A column that allows null values. UNIQUE constraints can be defined on
     * columns that allow null values, whereas PRIMARY KEY constraints can be
     * defined only on columns that do not allow null values.
     * </li>
     * </ul>
     * A UNIQUE constraint can also be referenced by a FOREIGN KEY constraint.
